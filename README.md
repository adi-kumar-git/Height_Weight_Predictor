# Height_Weight_Predictor
This project uses a simple linear regression model to predict a person's weight based on their height. The model was trained on a dataset containing height and weight data, and it was saved using joblib. The prediction model is deployed as a Streamlit web app, where users can input their height in centimeters, and the app predicts weight in kg
